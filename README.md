# Graduate Research - Blockchain Election System
My capstone research project consists of a web app front-end and a blockchain back-end on the ethereum network.
The web app was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The blockchain was written in solidity and tested with the Remix IDE.

Abstract: There are rules in place to ensure the fairness and security of an election. These rules, however, are useless if they arenâ€™t followed. An ideal solution to this issue is bypassing as much human interference as possible. At the same time, it is still important to retain a level of transparency. A blockchain based solution could help us achieve this.
